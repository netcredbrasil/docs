# API


This document serves as auxiliary documentation for NETCREDâ€™s API, it should be used in conjunction to the [*Playground*](https://sandbox.netcredbrasil.com.br/), in order to get the most out of the experience. This document will get you acquainted to creating charges, managing companies, marketplaces and financial contracts through NETCRED's ecosystem.

## Overview
The core concept needed for integration with this API is GraphQL. GraphQL is a query language for APIs and a runtime for fulfilling those queries with your existing data. GraphQL provides a complete and understandable description of the data, and gives clients the power to ask for exactly what they need and nothing more. You can learn more about it in the [*GraphQL Docs*](https://graphql.org/).


# Tutorials


A set of guides that will hopefully help you in the process of integration with this API.

Authentication takes place via **JWT** token, more details on this format at [*JWT Docs*](https://jwt.io/).

To authenticate you need to execute a tokenAuth request with your username and password. By a successful request, you receive a token to authenticate in other requests, it does lasts 24 hours from the moment of it's creation. 

Subsequent requests need the header  **"Authorization": "JWT {*your token*}"**.

The token can be refreshed for another 24 hours using the refreshToken* request (before it expires, of course), and you can check the time until its expiration using verifyToken.

For a better knowledge you can observe this diagram:

![Image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/netcredbrasil/docs/main/images/AUTHENTICATION.jpg)

*Observation: If expired, the token needs to be generated again.*


## Error Codes


When a *Error* happens, it will appear a **Error Code**. *Error codes* will help in the process of understanding the problem and how you can fix it. As an Example:

>PAYMENT_METHOD_INVALID = "Payment method is unknown"

When any mutation are made, you should retrieve the *errors* array, composed by "field" and "message", when running that mutation and a *error* proceed, will be displayed an **Error Code** in the results, compose by the name of the code and a quick description. 

A list with all the custom errors can be found directly in our Postman documentation.

- [*ChargeErrors*](https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/14324610/TW6urARy#f2c6361b-da1b-4e91-abd7-b9cc5fbab0af)
- [*CompanyErrors*](https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/14324610/TW6urARy#df8d54fd-587e-4b3f-bca1-2a05cceed6cb)
- [*WebhookErrors*](https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/14324610/TW6urARy#df8d54fd-587e-4b3f-bca1-2a05cceed6cb)


*Observation: An Error can be sorted in different ways and when a error are not expected a syntax error are a point that needed to be addressed.*


## UserType and Companies


very User needs to have an *UserType*, and even with the ambiguous name, an *UserType* is types of Company that an User needs to be associated with. 
To understand the companies types and how they correlate with them, you must have to know how they work, you will be able to find a complete description of each part of the companies in our [*Postman documentation*](https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/14324610/TW6urARy#dc73138e-3613-43d4-9436-5d570de279c4).


A **COMPANY** can be a **MERCHANT**, **MARKETPLACE**, **FACILITATOR**, **FINANCIER** or a **COMISSIONED**. And knowing all this types you need to know how each one of them are correlated each other, as viewed in this diagram:

![Image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/netcredbrasil/docs/main/images/COMPANY%20TYPES.jpg)


- A *FACILITATOR*, can intermediate a *MERCHANT*, *MARKETPLACE*, *FINANCIER* or a *COMISSIONED*;
- A *MERCHANT* can be part of a *MARKETPLACE*;
- A *MERCHANT* can be financed by a *FINANCIER*;
- A *MERCHANT* can comission a *COMISSIONED*;

Knowing all the types of Companies and how they work together, an useful information is the state of this companies. This is called *CompanyState* and this are them:

- *ACTIVE* - The company is active;
- *ACTIVE_MONITORED* - The company is Active with monitoring;
- *INACTIVE* - The company is inactive;
- *SUSPENDED* - The company is suspended;
- *AWAITING_APPROVAL* - The company is awaiting approval;

## Tokenization

Tokenization is the process of validating and storing a card for future use, and is required for recurring charges. A tokenization occurs automatically when the PaymentProfileCreate request is called for the method that is **CARD**.

Your return will be a PaymentProfile and you will be able to verify success according to some attributes.

In case of success, the value of the token attribute will be filled and the *isActive* attribute will be equal to true.

In case of rejection, the value of the token attribute will be empty and the *isActive* attribute will be equal to false. You can also check the *rejectedReason* for the reason for the refusal.

The *PaymentProfileType* also has access to *OperationType* objects, which contain more details about the tokenization operation.

It is worth noting that when trying to call this request for an equal *cardNumber* that already has a token, will result in only updating the different data of this card.

PaymentProfileVoid, removes the token from a **CARD** method *PaymentProfile* and makes that profile inactive, by setting *isActive* attribute to *false*, that same profile can be tokenized again using PaymentProfileCreate.

## Credit Charges

Credit Charges are one-time charges and don't need use a tokenized PaymentProfile to be created.

To create a credit charge, a maximum of 2 requests are required: CustomerCreate and ChargeCreate, and CustomerCreate is only necessary if the Customer has not been created previously. 

A ChargeCreate (or credit creation), inserts the PaymentProfile data through *PaymentProfileInput* object inline, and not on a new request, therefore it will not execute the Tokenization process.

Single or one-time charges are identified using the chargeType attribute, which will have the value SINGLE.

## Recurring Charges


As seen in this diagram:

![Images](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/netcredbrasil/docs/main/images/CHARGE%20RECURRING.jpg)

Recurring charges are, not surprisingly, charges that occur in a predefined recurring manner. If the method used is a credit card, it will need a Tokenized PaymentProfile since the data will be used in the future.

A minimun of 2 requests are required to create recurring charges: CustomerCreate, ChargeCreate. If the Customer has been already created, it is not necessary, the same goes for the PaymentProfile, and if the recurring charge is using BILLET method, the PaymentProfile can be created inline.

Recurring charges are identified using the chargeType attribute, which will have the value RECURRING.

In particular for recurring card charges, the tokenization process is required and using **RRULE** for the definition of recurrence, from the **RFC 5545** (*iCalendar*), here are some examples for the definition of recurrence from **RRULE**:

Every month on the first day of the month 30 times:

>*- FREQ=MONTHLY;INTERVAL=1;BYMONTHDAY=1;COUNT=30*

Starting 02/09/2021 (DD/MM/YYYY) every 10 days for a total o 5 times:

>*- DTSTART:20210902T000000 RRULE:FREQ=DAILY;INTERVAL=10;COUNT=5*

*Observation: If the RRULE makes the first charge today, it will be immediately charged, making it a normal request to subscription based services.*

RRULES can get very specific, we recommend taking a look at examples or tools that help building them like [this](https://www.textmagic.com/free-tools/rrule-generator).
